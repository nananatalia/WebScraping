Web Scraping Project: Fast Food Kids' Meal Prices
This project scrapes and analyzes kids' meal prices from McDonald's, KFC, and Burger King websites over 30 days. Built with Python, it uses BeautifulSoup and requests to extract pricing data and appends it to a CSV file for trend analysis.
Ideal for understanding pricing patterns and evaluating offers. The script respects ethical scraping practices but requires reviewing the targeted websites' Terms of Service for compliance.
